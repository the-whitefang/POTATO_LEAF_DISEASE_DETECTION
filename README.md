The "Potato Leaf Disease Detection" final year project aims to develop an intelligent system for the automated identification and classification of potato leaf diseases using advanced machine learning 
techniques. Leveraging a deep learning model, likely built on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and trained on a diverse dataset of potato leaf images, the project seeks to enhance precision and efficiency in 
diagnosing common diseases such as Early Blight, Late Blight, and distinguishing healthy leaves. By implementing this classification system, the project not only addresses critical issues in potato cultivation by 
providing early disease detection but also contributes to sustainable agriculture practices by facilitating timely and targeted interventions to mitigate crop losses. The project's interdisciplinary nature combines 
expertise in agricultural science, image processing, and machine learning, making it a valuable and impactful endeavor for the agricultural sector.
